#+TITLE: Python and 0MQ

* Introduction
  I'm Noufal Ibrahim

* Microservices
  - Large applications
  - Moving things to separate services
  - Communicate between them
  - Each thing can be separately scaled/managed
  - Each thing can be in a different language
  - Can be on separate machines

* Communication between services
  - Conventionally used a message bus
  - [[./bus.png]]  
  - The bus is a liability
  - A point of failure
  - RabbitMQ / AMQP

* Distributed message queue
  - Remove the message queue
  - So, MQ without an MQ
  - Or Zero MQ. i.e. 0MQ or ZMQ

* 0MQ
  - The distribution is still done.
  - But we don't have a server anymore.
  - Nodes have MQ infrastructure builtin.
  - More work, more scalable, more flexible.
  - [[./zmq-layout.png]]

* 0MQ
  - Uses the socket API
  - =socket=, =connect=, =accept=, =setsockopt= etc.
  - With some extensions

* Example  
  - Consider a simple fibonacci program.
  - [[./code/c0_fib.py][In Python]]
  - Now, this is a library.
  - Let's make this work as a [[file:code/c1_fib_service.py][small service]]
  - And write some simple [[file:code/perf01.py][performance]] [[file:code/perf02.py][scripts]]

* Current situation
  - [[./fib.png]]
  - Our service has just a single worker
  - Good single request performance.
  - Poor concurrent performance.

* New architecture
